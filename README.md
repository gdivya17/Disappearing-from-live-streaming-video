In this project, I learnt how to create my own ‘Invisibility Cloak’ using simple computer vision techniques in OpenCV. 
Here I have written this code in Python because it provides exhaustive and sufficient library to build this program.
I have created this magical experience using an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation. 
In order to run this code, we can use a video or stream live using webcam.
